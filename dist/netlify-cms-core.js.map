Methods that retrieve a single value\n * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence\n * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped\n * with `_#value`.\n *\n * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be\n * enabled using `_.chain`.\n *\n * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until\n * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.\n *\n * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.\n * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids\n * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of\n * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut\n * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only\n * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut\n * fusion is subject to change.\n *\n * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n *\n * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n *\n * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`\n *\n * The wrapper `String` methods are:\n * `replace` and `split`\n *\n * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:\n * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,\n * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,\n * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`\n *\n * The
